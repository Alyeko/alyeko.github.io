## About
For this project, selected African cities were chosen, coordinates obtained from google and geocoded with geopy.
Folium was used to make an interactive maps with appropriate popups. 
Two articles [Making Cool Maps with Geopy and Folium](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-simple-maps-with-folium-and-geopy-4b9e8ab98c00) and [Your Cool Folium Maps on the Web](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-cool-folium-maps-on-the-web-313f9d1a6bcd)were written to share how to create an interactive map, visualizing African cities with Geopy and Folium, and how to finally deploy it to the web. 

## Interactive map
[The interactive map can be seen here](https://interactive-folium-map.herokuapp.com) Interactive maps are a way to present data at particular geographic locations in an aesthetically pleasing way.
