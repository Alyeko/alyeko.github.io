# Descision Making System for Tennis Sports Complex
**Tools Used: PostgreSQL/Postgis, QGIS** 

**Description:** 
In this project, a spatial database was created in PostgreSQL from scratch, 7 decisions were made with the data created and a QGIS visualization was finally made.

1. Tables were created together with unique and check constraints <br/>
2. Data was inserted into the tables <br/>
3. Views were created to aid in simpler querying for decision making <br/>
4. The data was then finally visualized in QGIS <br/>
