# Cool Maps with Folium 
**Tools Used: Python, Geopandas, Geopy, Folium** 

**Description:** 

For this project, selected African cities were chosen, coordinates obtained from a google search, and geocoded with geopy.
Folium was used to make an interactive map with appropriate popups. 

Two articles [Making Cool Maps with Geopy and Folium](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-simple-maps-with-folium-and-geopy-4b9e8ab98c00) and [Your Cool Folium Maps on the Web](https://towardsdatascience.com/your-cool-folium-maps-on-the-web-313f9d1a6bcd) were written to share how to create the interactive map, visualizing African cities, and how to finally make deployment to the web, with heroku.

Interactive maps are a way to present data at particular geographic locations in an aesthetically pleasing way.
